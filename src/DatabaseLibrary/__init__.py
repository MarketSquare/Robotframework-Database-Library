class DatabaseLibrary(ConnectionManager, Query, Assertion):
    """
    The Database Library for [https://robotframework.org|Robot Framework] allows you to query a database and verify the results.
    It requires an appropriate *Python module to be installed separately* - depending on your database, like e.g. `oracledb` or `pymysql`.

    == Table of contents ==
    %TOC%

    = Requirements =
    - Python
    - Robot Framework
    - Python database module you're going to use - e.g. `oracledb`

    = Installation =
    | pip install robotframework-databaselibrary
    Don't forget to install the required Python database module!

    = Usage example =
    == Basic usage ==
    | *** Settings ***
    | Library       DatabaseLibrary
    | Test Setup    Connect To My Oracle DB
    |
    | *** Keywords ***
    | Connect To My Oracle DB
    |     Connect To Database
    |     ...    oracledb
    |     ...    dbName=db
    |     ...    dbUsername=my_user
    |     ...    dbPassword=my_pass
    |     ...    dbHost=127.0.0.1
    |     ...    dbPort=1521
    |
    | *** Test Cases ***
    | Person Table Contains Expected Records
    |     ${output}=    Query    select LAST_NAME from person
    |     Length Should Be    ${output}    2
    |     Should Be Equal    ${output}[0][0]    See
    |     Should Be Equal    ${output}[1][0]    Schneider
    |
    | Person Table Contains No Joe
    |     ${sql}=    Catenate    SELECT id FROM person
    |     ...                    WHERE FIRST_NAME= 'Joe'
    |     Check If Not Exists In Database    ${sql}
    |

    == Handling multiple database connections ==
    | *** Settings ***
    | Library          DatabaseLibrary
    | Test Setup       Connect To All Databases
    | Test Teardown    Disconnect From All Databases
    |
    | *** Keywords ***
    | Connect To All Databases
    |     Connect To Database    psycopg2    db    db_user    pass    127.0.0.1    5432
    |     ...    alias=postgres
    |     Connect To Database    pymysql    db    db_user    pass    127.0.0.1    3306
    |     ...    alias=mysql
    |
    | *** Test Cases ***
    | Using Aliases
    |     ${names}=    Query    select LAST_NAME from person    alias=postgres
    |     Execute Sql String    drop table XYZ                  alias=mysql
    |
    | Switching Default Alias
    |     Switch Database    postgres
    |     ${names}=    Query    select LAST_NAME from person
    |     Switch Database    mysql
    |     Execute Sql String    drop table XYZ
    |

    = Inline assertions =
    Keywords that accept arguments ``assertion_operator`` <`AssertionOperator`> and ``expected_value``
    perform a check according to the specified condition - using the [https://github.com/MarketSquare/AssertionEngine|Assertion Engine].
    |   Check Row Count       SELECT id FROM person            ==         2
    |   Check Query Result    SELECT first_name FROM person    contains   Allan

    = Database modules compatibility =
    The library is basically compatible with any [https://peps.python.org/pep-0249|Python Database API Specification 2.0] module.

    However, the actual implementation in existing Python modules is sometimes quite different, which requires custom handling in the library.
    Therefore, there are some modules, which are "natively" supported in the library - and others, which may work and may not.

    See more on the [https://github.com/MarketSquare/Robotframework-Database-Library|project page on GitHub].
