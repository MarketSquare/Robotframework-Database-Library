        Uses the input `selectStatement` to query for the values that
        will be returned as a list of tuples.

        Tip: Unless you want to log all column values of the specified rows,
        try specifying the column names in your select statements
        as much as possible to prevent any unnecessary surprises with schema
        changes and to easily see what your [] indexing is trying to retrieve
        (i.e. instead of `"select * from my_table"`, try
        `"select id, col_1, col_2 from my_table"`).

        For example, given we have a table `person` with the following data:
        | id | first_name  | last_name |
        |  1 | Franz Allan | See       |

        When you do the following:
        | @{queryResults} | Query | SELECT * FROM person |
        | Log Many | @{queryResults} |

        You will get the following:
        [1, 'Franz Allan', 'See']

        Also, you can do something like this:
        | ${queryResults} | Query | SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person |
        | Log | ${queryResults[0][1]}, ${queryResults[0][0]} |

    def execute_sql_script(self, sqlScriptFileName):
        """
        Executes the content of the `sqlScriptFileName` as SQL commands.
        Useful for setting the database to a known state before running
        your tests, or clearing out your test data after running each a
        test.

        Sample usage :
        | Execute Sql Script | ${EXECDIR}${/}resources${/}DDL-setup.sql |
        | Execute Sql Script | ${EXECDIR}${/}resources${/}DML-setup.sql |
        | #interesting stuff here |
        | Execute Sql Script | ${EXECDIR}${/}resources${/}DML-teardown.sql |
        | Execute Sql Script | ${EXECDIR}${/}resources${/}DDL-teardown.sql |

        SQL commands are expected to be delimited by a semi-colon (';').

        For example:
        DELETE FROM person_employee_table;
        DELETE FROM person_table;
        DELETE FROM employee_table;

        Also, the last SQL command can optionally omit its trailing semi-colon.

        For example:
        DELETE FROM person_employee_table;
        DELETE FROM person_table;
        DELETE FROM employee_table

        Given this, that means you can create spread your SQL commands in several
        lines.

        For example:
        DELETE
          FROM person_employee_table;
        DELETE
          FROM person_table;
        DELETE
          FROM employee_table

        However, lines that starts with a number sign (`#`) are treated as a
        commented line. Thus, none of the contents of that line will be executed.

        For example:
        # Delete the bridging table first...
        DELETE
          FROM person_employee_table;
          # ...and then the bridged tables.
        DELETE
          FROM person_table;

          FROM employee_table
