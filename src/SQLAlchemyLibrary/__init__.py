    Database Library contains utilities meant for Robot Framework's usage.

    This can allow you to query your database after an action has been made to verify the results.

    This is `compatible*` with any Database API Specification 2.0 module.

    Notes:



    `compatible* - or at least theoretically it should be compatible. Currently tested only with postgresql
    (using psycopg2).`

    Example Usage:
    | # Setup |
    | Connect to Database |
    | # Guard assertion (verify that test started in expected state). |
    | Check if not exists in database | select id from person where first_name = 'Franz Allan' and last_name = 'See' |
    | # Drive UI to do some action |
    | Go To | http://localhost/person/form.html | | # From selenium library |
    | Input Text |  name=first_name | Franz Allan | # From selenium library |
    | Input Text |  name=last_name | See | # From selenium library |
    | Click Button | Save | | # From selenium library |
    | # Log results |
    | @{queryResults} | Query | select * from person |
    | Log Many | @{queryResults} |
    | # Verify if persisted in the database |
    | Check if exists in database | select id from person where first_name = 'Franz Allan' and last_name = 'See' |
    | # Teardown |
    | Disconnect from Database |
