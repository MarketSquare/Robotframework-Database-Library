Robotframework-SQLAlchemy-Library
===============================

SQLAlchemy Library contains utilities meant for Robot Framework's usage. This can allow you to query your database after an action has been made to verify the results.

This is a fork of Robotframework-Database-Library that uses SQLAlchemy Core instead of directly using the Python Database API.
